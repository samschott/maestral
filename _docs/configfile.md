title: Configuration file

The config files are located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/maestral` on Linux (typically
`~/.config/maestral`) and `~/Library/Application Support/maestral` on macOS. Each
configuration will get its own INI file with the settings documented below.

Changes to the config values may be performed through [`maestral config set`]({{
site.baseurl }}/cli/config) directly but some will only take effect once you restart
Maestral. Editing the config file by hand is also possible if the sync daemon is not
running, they will be overwritten otherwise.

**You must not change the `path` and `excluded_items` config values manually** but rather
use the corresponding CLI commands or GUI options, for instance
[`maestral move-dir`]({{ site.baseurl }}/cli/move-dir) or
[`maestral excluded add`]({{site.baseurl }}/cli/excluded). This is because changes of
these settings require Maestral to perform accompanying actions, e.g., download folders
which have been removed from the excluded list or move the local Dropbox directory.
Those will not be performed if you edit the values directly.

This also holds for the `account_id` config value which will be written to the config
file after successfully completing the OAuth flow with Dropbox servers.

```ini

[auth]

# Unique Dropbox account ID. The account's email
# address may change and is therefore not stored here.
account_id = dbid:AABP7CC5bpYd8cGHqIColDFrMoc9SdhACA4

# The keychain to use to store user credentials. If "automatic",
# will be set automatically from available backends when 
# completing the OAuth flow. Mus be a fully qualified class name.
keyring = keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring
